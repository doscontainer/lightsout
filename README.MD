# FreeBSD LightsOut

This is a very early stages command line utility that turns the display off on the
laptop that I use as a FreeBSD server in my homelab. It's cruddy, mostly AI-generated
at this point and not even properly tested.

If this code breaks your machine or eats your homework, don't blame me. I intend to
refine it later, but I don't have time for anything right now.
